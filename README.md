I do not like the News icon/feature which Facebook has implemented, so I made a quick and simple browser extension to delete it. Currently only written for the Chrome browser. Works automatically upon opening Facebook.

- Open the Chrome Extensions tab (chrome://extensions/).
- In the upper right-hand corner, toggle "Developer Mode" on.
- In the upper left-hand corner click "Load Unpacked".
- Choose the extension file that you downloaded and then hit "Select Folder".
- Now it should be installed, make sure it is toggled on!
